## EMMM to Float, Float to EMMM conversion


</div>

### Description

For those folk that play with EMMM stuff, finally something you can use. I got these calculation (entirely done in VB, not C) from a great guy somewhere in the US. It really helped me. Maybe it will help someone else in the world. The problem I had was that I had a hardware device that recorded information in EMMM format. This data could be downloaded through RS232, but for me to use this data in VB, I had to convert it from EMMM (2 byte float) to a data type "Single" (VB float). I do not think many people will be using it (maybe you prefer to use C).
